    "\n",
    "In order to explore my research question I will be looking at data from 2019 as my control and comparing it to reports from 2020 to observe the impact of Covid-19. More specifcally, I am expecting to look at data concering food stamps, applications and/or increase to subsidies housing and other data points which are indicators of homelessness. Through this I hope to gain insight on what challenges have increased due towards our most vulnernable communities.\n"

Current research in this area is most concered about identifying priority areas to help mitigate challenges with isolation, getting a grasp of the mortality specifc, hospitalization and urgent care capacity needs and more (https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/26/E716.short). \n",

    "Specifc to Seattle, I stumbled onto a Seattle Times article from December 2020 speaking about the reportedly low number of Covid-19 cases in homeless camps. The article goes on to multiple residents of the homeless camp, however there seems to be resounding skeptimism about such low reports. Additionally reading about how majority of the homeless population has negative experinces assocaited with the health care system makes me conisder that people would not be inclinded to seek medical attention unless in an dire situtaion (https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/mysteriously-covid-hasnt-spread-among-seattles-vulnerable-homeless-population-what-does-that-mean-for-a-vaccine/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus I also want to look at data about what percentage of reported Covid-19 cases are also part of the homeless population. I believe that an age might also play a large factor as we have come to understand that Covid-19 is most harmful to senior citzens and individuals with pre-disposed conditions. I will also be looking at rise in temporary isolation stations (such as motels/hotels) and population change in homeless camp (I am unsure if camps will have updated data) or shelters. \n",
