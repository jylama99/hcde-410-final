# hcde-410-final
HCDE 410 Final Project (UW Spring 2021)

This project seeks to look at the impact of Covid-19 to the population facing homelessness in the Seattle King County area.

In order to explore my research question I will be looking at data from 2019 as my control and comparing it to reports from 2020 to observe the impact of Covid-19. More specifcally, I am expecting to look at data concering food stamps, applications and/or increase to subsidies housing and other data points which are indicators of homelessness. Through this I hope to gain insight on what challenges have increased due towards our most vulnernable communities.
