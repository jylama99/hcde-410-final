# hcde-410-final
HCDE 410 Final Project (UW Spring 2021)

This project seeks to look at the impact of Covid-19 to the population facing homelessness in the Seattle King County area.

In order to explore my research question I will be looking at data from 2019 as my control and comparing it to reports from 2020 to observe the impact of Covid-19. More specifcally, I am expecting to look at data concering food stamps, applications and/or increase to subsidies housing and other data points which are indicators of homelessness. Through this I hope to gain insight on what challenges have increased due towards our most vulnernable communities. To get an overview of my study please refer to the Report notebook.

The data sets I am looking at are: 

1. Dataset 1: Cause of Homelessness<br>
   Varibles:<br>
       a. Causes of Homelessness Post-Covid 2020<br>
       b. Causes of Homelessness Pre-Covid 2019<br>
       
2. Dataset 2: Sheltered/Unshelreted Population<br>
   Variables:<br>
       a. Sheltered and Unsheltered Persons Post-Covid 2020<br>
       b. Sheltered and Unsheltered Persons Pre-Covid 2019<br>
