    "## Discussion and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first dataset looking at the causes of homelessness both at my findings and visualizations, we can see that housing causes overall pre-Covid was greater than post/during Covid. This could be becuase the data recorded was not done as well as pre-Covid due to Covid restrictions. It could be infered that there are other factors such as mental health, domestic abuse, etc. which are leading causes of homelessness during and post Covid. However, when breaking down the differed causes accroding to the visualizations there was an increase in eviction as the cause by 13.1% from pre-Covid to post/during Covid. Similarly, with the medical reasons, knowing that the homeless population are wary of the healthcare system, Covid most likely poses as an extra threat and barrier, could hinder more accurate data collection.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the second dataset looking at the homeless populaiton reported to be sheltered or unsheltered there were slightly more shelreted than unsheltered both pre and post/during Covid. This precentage between the two should be looked at with skepticism beccause it is much more difficult to track and record unsheltered individuals. When looking at the count we can see overall that there was a rise is both sheltered and unsheltered indivudals post/during Covid. This falls in line with many of the claims from my background research of the expected rise of homelessness in Seattle, this current finding cannot discern if this increse is specifc to Covid."

    "Reflecting back on the study there could have data sets to work with however once again my main resouce were annual reports produced by the Regional Homelessness Authority of Seattle (King County). Thus here are sugggestions for direction to further explore and expand this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compare the issues the \"non-homeless\" population is facing in comparsion to see what issues might be specifc to the homeless population.\n",
    "2. Look into the impact of Covid to homelessness on different regions within Seattle, and how race and gentrification might play a role. \n",
    "3. Explore the impact of Covid on youth homelessness (age up to 22 to consider those recently out of foster care).\n",
